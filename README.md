# Orange Country MS4 program review

This repository includes materials for reviewing Orange County (California, USA) MS4 monitoring program data.

## Overview

The Orange County Public Works (OCPW, [website](http://www.ocpublicworks.com/)) program has monitored surface waters in north Orange County, California for several decades.  These data are collected for the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program established under the US Clean Water Act.  Data collected by OCPW under the MS4 program include mass emissions of 1) watershed load estimates, 2) dry weather reconnaissance monitoring, 3) biological sampling for bioassessment in urban streams, 4) monitoring of downstream harbors and estuaries, and 4) QA/QC for lab control samples.  Because of the size and cost of the program, periodic assessment to evaluate effectiveness and efficiencies in sampling design are required.  The monitoring program has not been critically reviewed in five years and an assessment with recommendations for future monitoring actions will support negotiation of a new MS4 permit.  

The goal of this project is to develop recommendations for evolving/upgrading the current monitoring program to make it both more effective (better information) and more efficient (cost).  With the critique for where improvements can be made, and with recommendations for improvement and an associated design toolkit, OCPW will have a solid technical foundation for negotiating the next MS4 monitoring and reporting program.  A technical committee was convened in July 2019 to begin discussing program needs and to outline critical questions that the monitoring program should answer for the next permitting period.    

Review of the OC monitoring program includes four steps:

1. Develop monitoring questions
1. Evaluate how well the existing monitoring program answers your questions
1. Create monitoring designs that most effectively answer your monitoring questions
1. Recommendations report

Through initial discussions, the review committee identified several general questions of interest in reviewing the monitoring program.  These questions include the following: 

* What is the temporal trend in pollutant loading?
* Are concentrations below water quality thresholds?
* What are the sources of pollutant loading?
* What is the effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs)?
* What are the [natural] background levels of pollutants?
* What is the status and trends of receiving water biological condition?
* What are the trends in tissue concentrations?
* Are there illicit connections/illegal discharges (IC/ID) 
* What is the status of program effectiveness?
* How can OC monitoring link/incorporate non-permit monitoring data?

This website provides technical material that addresses several of these questions. Specifically, the website provides quantitative information to evaluate the current status of water quality constituents relative to important thresholds or magnitudes with policy or management implication, past trends in relation to known management actions or other events that may have influenced water quality conditions, and power to detect trends or magnitude of exceedances with potential changes in sampling design. Recommendations for monitoring program will be based on results from the website to identify changes that should occur for addressing priority questions for the next five years.  These recommendations will be made based on the need to improve the quality of the information obtained from monitoring and reduce the overall costs associated with sampling.  

<!-- ## Methods -->

<!-- This plot shows 20 simulated time series of trends that are based on variance estimates from the observed time series.  Four types of simulations are shown.  In the top left, a trend of 30\% change from the original value is shown with a sampling effort of 30\% that of the original time series. In the top right, a trend of 30\% change from the original value is shown with a sampling effort of 100\% that of the original time series. In the bottom left, a trend of 100\% change from the original value is shown with a sampling effort of 30\% that of the original time series. In the bottom left, a trend of 100\% change from the original value is shown with a sampling effort of 10\% that of the original time series. Lines in red are significant ($\alpha$ = 0.05) based on results of a linear trend analysis.  The total power is based on the number of significant results for each scenario divided by the total number of simulations (n = 20 for each).  As such, increasing power is observed with stronger trends and higher sampling densities. -->
