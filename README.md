## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop recommendations for evolving/upgrading the current monitoring program to make it both more effective (better information) and more efficient (cost).  A typical review includes four steps:

1) Develop monitoring questions
1) Evaluate how well the existing monitoring program answers your questions
1) Create monitoring designs that most effectively answer your monitoring questions
1) Recommendations report

The current monitoring program includes the following elements:

* Mass emissions
* Harbors and estuaries
* Urban stream bioassessment
* Dry weather reconnaissance
* QA/QC for lab control samples

Elements of a good monitoring question include: 

* Where and how much time applies to what you’re monitoring?
* What indicators do you measure?
* What’s the benchmark for comparison?
* What action is taken once you have an answer?

General questions of interest in reviewing the program include the following: 

* What is the temporal trend in pollutant loading?
* Are concentrations below water quality thresholds?
* What are the sources of pollutant loading?
* What is the effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs)?
* What are the [natural] background levels of pollutants?
* What is the status and trends of receiving water biological condition?
* What are the trends in tissue concentrations?
* Are there illicit connections/illegal discharges (IC/ID) 
* What is the status of program effectiveness?
* How can OC monitoring link/incorporate non-permit monitoring data?
